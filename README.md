### 🚀 A Distributed Bioinformatics Search Engine

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is a **High-Performance Distributed System** designed to index and analyze human genome sequencing data. Unlike traditional SQL databases, this system utilizes a **custom-built C++ Database Engine** powered by **B-Trees** and **Hash Tables** to achieve milliseconds retrieval time for massive DNA records.

The system features a decoupled **3-Tier Architecture**, separating the React GUI from the C++ Logic and Binary Disk Storage.
